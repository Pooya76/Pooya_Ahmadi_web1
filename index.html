			<p> &nbsp<b>Canada</b> is a country in 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" target="_blank">North America</a>. 
			Its ten provinces and three territories extend from
			the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean<br/>covering 9.98 million square
			kilometres (3.85 million square miles), making it the world's second-largest country by total
			area.<br/>Its southern and western border with the United States, stretching 8,891 kilometres
			(5,525 mi), is the world's longest bi-national land border.<br/>Canada's capital is Ottawa
			, and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.

			<p>&nbsp Indigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years.
			Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored<br/> and later settled
			along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly
			all of its colonies in North America in 1763.<br/> In 1867, with the union of three British North
			American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of
			four provinces.<br/> This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of
			increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom. <br/>This widening autonomy was highlighted by
			the Statute of Westminster 1931 and culminated in the Canada Act 1982,<br/> which severed
			the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
			A highly developed country, Canada has the 26th highest nominal per-capita income globally and the sixteenth-highest ranking in the Human Development Index.<br/>
			Its advanced economy is the ninth-largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. <br/>
			Canada is part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations, NATO, the G7, the Group of Ten, the G20<br/>
			the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Commonwealth of Nations, the Arctic Council, the Organisation<br/>
			internationale de la Francophonie, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and the Organization of American States.</p>

				<strong>Etymology</strong>
				<hr/>
				<p>While a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of Canada<br/>
				the name is now accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata, meaning <q>village</q> or <q>settlement</q>.<sup>[12]</sup>

				<strong>History</strong>
				<hr/>
				<h5>Indigenous peoples</h5>
				<p>
				Indigenous peoples in present-day Canada include the First Nations, Inuit, and MÃ©tis,the last being of mixed descent who originated in the mid-17th century when<br/>
				First Nations people married European settlers and subsequently developed their own identity.<br/>

				The first inhabitants of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 14,000 years ago.<br/>
				The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada.<br/>
				
				</p>
				<h5>European colonization</h5>
				<p>
				It is believed that the first European to explore the east coast of Canada was Norse explorer Leif Erikson. In approximately 1000 AD, the Norse built a small<br/>
				encampment that only lasted a few years at L'Anse aux Meadows on the northern tip of Newfoundland. No further European exploration occurred until 1497,<br/>
				when Italian seafarer John Cabot explored and claimed Canada's Atlantic coast in the name of King Henry VII of England<br/>
