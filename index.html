	<p> &nbsp<b>Canada</b> is a country in 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" target="_blank">North America</a>. 
	Its ten provinces and three territories extend from
	the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean<br/>covering 9.98 million square
	kilometres (3.85 million square miles), making it the world's second-largest country by total
	area.<br/>Its southern and western border with the United States, stretching 8,891 kilometres
	(5,525 mi), is the world's longest bi-national land border.<br/>Canada's capital is Ottawa
	, and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.

	<p>&nbsp Indigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years.
	Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored<br/> and later settled
	along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly
	all of its colonies in North America in 1763.<br/> In 1867, with the union of three British North
	American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of
	four provinces.<br/> This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of
	increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom. <br/>This widening autonomy was highlighted by
	the Statute of Westminster 1931 and culminated in the Canada Act 1982,<br/> which severed
	the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
	A highly developed country, Canada has the 26th highest nominal per-capita income globally and the sixteenth-highest ranking in the Human Development Index.<br/>
	Its advanced economy is the ninth-largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. <br/>
	Canada is part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations, NATO, the G7, the Group of Ten, the G20<br/>
	the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Commonwealth of Nations, the Arctic Council, the Organisation<br/>
	internationale de la Francophonie, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and the Organization of American States.</p>

	<strong>Etymology</strong>
	<hr/>
	<p>While a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of Canada<br/>
	the name is now accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata, meaning <q>village</q> or <q>settlement</q>.<sup>[12]</sup>
